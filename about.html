meta: As huge nerd, it's easy to get overtly passionate about the things that intrest me. Art, film, pop culture and books fuel my passion for design and seep into my work. I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts & Cinematography and am fluent in Adobe CC. (I also have impeccable movie knowledge for trivia nights.)
